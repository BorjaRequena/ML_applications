    "The focus is put on the application and the results without diving into the architecture details and parameters. We mainly use [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) to perform the demonstration and we encourage the reader to look at their [wonderful course](https://course.fast.ai/) and [book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527).\n",
